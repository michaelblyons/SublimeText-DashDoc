# [Sublime Text Docset][self]

[Dash][] and [Zeal][] docset for [Sublime Text][st]’s official
[documentation][st-docs].
There is also a small docset for [Sublime Merge][sm].


## Installation

### Install from a feed

This is likely more convenient because updates will be downloaded
to your application automatically.

#### Dash

Dash has built-in support for their user-contributed docsets.
Go to *Preferences* > *Downloads* > *User Contributed*
to search for "Sublime" and install the community-org maintained ones.

#### Zeal

Zeal does not have a direct search for user-contributed docsets.
In Zeal, go to *Tools* > *Docsets&hellip;* > *Add feed*
and paste in the URL(s) to the respective [third-party][zuc]'s repacked feed:

```
https://zealusercontributions.vercel.app/api/docsets/Sublime_Text.xml
```
```
https://zealusercontributions.vercel.app/api/docsets/Sublime_Merge.xml
```

### Install manually

Download from [GitHub Releases][releases]
or build yourself with the instructions below.

- If you have a `docset-bundle.zip` from GitHub, extract it somewhere.
- If you build yourself, `sublime-text.docset` will be in the
`out` folder.

#### Install a local folder to Dash

It may be possible to just double-click `sublime-text.docset`.
If that doesn't work:

1. Open Dash.
1. <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd>
1. Open the "Docsets" tab.
1. Click the <kbd>+</kbd>.
1. Choose "Add Local Docset".
1. Select `sublime-text.docset`.
1. Optionally change the keyword.
1. Repeat for `sublime-merge.docset`.

####  Install a local folder to Zeal

If you built yourself and you have default Linux folders,
just `make install-linux`.
Otherwise:

1. Find your docset folder ("Docset storage" in your Preferences).
1. Copy or symlink `sublime-text.docset` to that folder.
1. Repeat for `sublime-merge.docset`.
